<p>I train myself to develop in the
technology sector, both in
programming and in surveying
client needs. I have active listening
and problem-solving abilities. I am
a team player, sensitive to the
needs of the work group and
clients. With a great capacity for
analysis and innovative thinking,
which leads me to look for
ingenious solutions in complex
environments.</p>
